productapi

This is a service which uses apollo graphql with integration to expresjs to resolves queries. Backend database is mongodb. 
It provide data to the commerce App. (https://github.com/appcoreopc/commerceApp)

Gatsbyjs image sharp plugin for static content is ok. Just sometimes, product images are created dynamically. 
that's why it is important to have a image api to take over this job. 

Need a message queue integration to handle huge product upload and price info.
